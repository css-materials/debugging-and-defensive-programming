# CONDITION HANDLING


# Calculate the square root of the sum of two numbers
sqrt_sum <- function(x, y){
  sqrt(sum(x, y))
}
sqrt_sum(3, 6)


## Rewrite sqrt_sum() to produce a fatal error any time
## the sum of the two numbers is negative


## Rewrite sqrt_sum() to return a missing value (`NA`) any time
## the sum of the two numbers is negative and produce a warning message
## explaining why this happened
